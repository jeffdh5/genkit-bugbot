Analyze this {{language}} code for STYLE and READABILITY ONLY.

```{{language}}
{{code}}
```

Look for:
- Poor naming
- Missing docstrings
- Overly complex functions
- Magic numbers
- Code duplication

IMPORTANT:
- Only report STYLE issues. Do not report security issues or bugs.
- Include the exact line number where the issue occurs.
- All issues must have category: "style"
- Be pragmatic. Minor nits are "info" severity.
- If the code is clean, return an empty issues list.
